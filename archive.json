This approach is essential in dynamic networks with mobile nodes, where links may be frequently disrupted and re-established due to mobility, or in networks with highly predictable traffic patterns, where links may be powered down to conserve or reduce energy.\r\n\r\nThis document provides examples of implementing TVR scheduling capabilities in identified use cases. It demonstrates the applicability of the TVR data model, methods for disseminating the TVR schedule, and the necessary IETF ancillary technologies for network environments, such as time synchronization and policy, that support TVR capabilities.\r\n<<",

In this document, a tidal demand use case has been presented, highlighting the need for robust security measures in the processes of generating, disseminating, and applying schedules to control tidal interfaces. It is essential to assess security risks and implement mitigation strategies to ensure the security of both the network and individual nodes throughout the scheduling process.\r\n\r\nFuture iterations of this document will provide detailed security techniques and best practices to address these challenges.\r\n<<\r\n",

RESTConf Example\r\n\r\nTo \"4.5 Management Protocols for TVR\", then add the following text:\r\n\r\nThe TVR data model is designed to be accessed via YANG-based management protocols such as NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040]. This section discusses the applicability of these protocols for configuring time-variant network resources using the TVR YANG data models.\r\n\r\nNETCONF provides a robust mechanism for managing complex network configurations, particularly when transactional integrity and operational consistency are required. Its ability to execute atomic transactions ensures that schedules involving multiple resources are applied in full, preventing partial updates that could lead to configuration inconsistencies. This feature is important for time-sensitive scheduling in TVR environments. Additionally, NETCONF supports validation of configurations prior to commitment, allowing operators to verify the correctness of schedules before they are applied. It also includes rollback capabilities, enabling the restoration of a previous configuration in the event of scheduling errors.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, RESTCONF offers a simpler, stateless method for interacting with network devices, making it suitable for use cases requiring lightweight, rapid configuration. RESTCONF utilizes a RESTful interface over HTTP, providing a streamlined approach to network configuration and management. Therefore, RESTCONF may be advantageous in scenarios where quick adjustments to schedules are needed or where integration with web-based or cloud-native systems is a priority.\r\n\r\nDepending on the type of node in the TVR network, NETCONF would be the preferred protocol for large-scale, critical scheduling operations requiring validation and rollback mechanisms. For smaller-scale or isolated scheduling tasks, RESTCONF provides an efficient and straightforward option without the need for the transactional features offered by NETCONF. The choice of protocol to use with the TVR YANG model should be driven by the specific requirements of the network environment and the complexity of the scheduling tasks involved.\r\n\r\nThe security aspects of both NETCONF and RESTCONF including the strengths and weaknesses, are discussed further in Section 8 (\"Security Considerations\") of this document. \r\n<<",
