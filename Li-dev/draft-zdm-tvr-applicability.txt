1.  Introduction

   The Time-Variant Routing (TVR) Working Group addresses a growing need
   in modern network environments where predictable variations in
   topology - such as the restoration, activation, or loss of network
   elements, are part of normal operations.  This approach is essential
   in dynamic networks with mobile nodes, where links may be frequently
   disrupted and re-established due to mobility, or in networks with
   highly predictable traffic patterns, where links may be powered down
   to conserve or reduce energy.

   This document provides examples of implementing TVR scheduling
   capabilities in identified use cases.  It demonstrates the
   applicability of the TVR data model, methods for disseminating the
   TVR schedule, and the necessary IETF ancillary technologies for
   network environments, such as time synchronization and policy, that
   support TVR capabilities.

3.  Applicability and Use Case Examples

   ## Tidal Network Use Case

   Tidal network is a typical scenario of Energy Efficient case
   (Section 3 of [I-D.ietf-tvr-use-cases]).  The tidal network means
   that the volume of traffic in the network changes periodically like
   the ocean tide.  These changes are mainly affected by human
   activities.  Therefore, this tidal effect is obvious in human-
   populated areas, such as campuses and airports.

   In the context of a tidal network, if the network maintains all the
   devices up to guarantee a maximum throughput all the time, a lot of
   power will be wasted.  The energy-saving methods may include the
   deactivation of some or all components of network nodes.  These
   activities have the potential to alter network topology and impact
   data routing/forwarding in a variety of ways.  Interfaces on network
   nodes can be selectively disabled or enabled based on traffic
   patterns, thereby reducing the energy consumption of nodes during
   periods of low network traffic.  The following clauses will describe
   how to use TVR YANG model[I-D.ietf-tvr-schedule-yang] in Tidal
   Network.

4.  Applicability of TVR Yang Model in Tidal Network

4.1.  Network Model

   According to the description of Section 3.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-tvr-requirements], the scheduling generation locality and
   execution locality may be centralized or distributed.

   When the schedule is generated and executed in a centralized manner,
   the changes are sent to routing applications in wall-clock time via a
   management interface, which does not need to be delivered by YANG
   model.  This can be implemented by the existing management plane
   technology.  Therefore, this scenario is outside of the scope of this
   document.

   When the schedule is generated and executed in a distributed manner,
   there is also no need for delivering the schedule by YANG model.
   Therefore, this scenario is also outside of the scope of this
   document.

   When a schedule is generated in a centralized manner and executed in
   a distributed manner, the YANG module needs to be used to deliver the
   schedule to the managed device.  Depending on the location of the
   routing application, the network model can be devided into two types:
   distributed and centralized.

4.1.1.  Centralized Model

   In the centralized model, the network managing device generates and
   maintains schedules, the routing application is deployed in the
   network controller, and the network devices execute the schedules and
   routing results.  The following figure shows the components of
   centralized model.

4.1.2.  Distributed Model

   In the distributed model, the managing device generates and maintains
   schedules, the routing application is deployed in the network devices
   who also executes schedules and route calculation.

4.2.  Interaction Between Devices

4.2.1.  Centralized Model

   Centralized model involves the interaction between the managing
   device and network controller, the managing device and network
   devices, and the controller and network devices.

   The managing device needs to deliver node-specific schedules to
   network devices by TVR Schedule Node YANG module Section 5.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-tvr-schedule-yang], and the network devices need to report
   their own status data to the management device.

   The managing device needs to deliver schedules of the network
   topology to the network controller by the TVR Network Topology YANG
   moduleSection 5.3 of [I-D.ietf-tvr-schedule-yang], so that the
   routing application in the controller can consider the impact of
   topology changes on routes when calculating routes.

   The network controller needs to delivers the route calculation result
   to the network devices(The format of the routing results depending on
   the protocols deployed).  The routing result for a period of time in
   the future could be sent to the network devices in wall-clock time or
   be packed and send at some special points.

4.2.2.  Distributed Model

   The distributed model only involves the interaction between managing
   device and network devices.

   The managing device needs to deliver node-specific schedules to
   network devices by TVR Schedule Node YANG Module, and deliver network
   topology schedules to the all the network devices by TVR Network
   Topology Yang module for route calculation.  The network devices need
   to report their own status data to the managing device.

4.3.  Yang Model for Tidal Network

   The following provides a list of applicable YANG modules that can be
   used to exchange data between devices:

   The "ietf-tvr-topology" YANG module in [I-D.ietf-tvr-schedule-yang]
   is used to manage the node and deliver network topology with time-
   varying attributes (e.g., node/link availability, link bandwidth, or
   delay).

   The "ietf-tvr-node" YANG module in [I-D.ietf-tvr-schedule-yang] which
   is a device model, is designed to manage a single node with scheduled
   attributes (e.g., powered on/off).

4.4.  Encoding of Yang Model

   The TVR data model [I-D.ietf-tvr-schedule-yang] can be used to manage
   network resources and topologies with scheduled attributes.  There
   are modules defined in the TVR data model, these are:

   *  Module ietf-tvr-schedule.yang contains the schedule YANG
      definitions.  This module uses groupings from
      [I-D.ietf-netmod-schedule-yang] data model;

   *  Module ietf-tvr-topology.yang defines a network topology with
      time-variant availability schedule;

   *  Module ietf-tvr-node.yang is to be used to manage scheduled
      attributes of a single node.

   To create a schedule the following TVR data model objects and
   subsequent branches are used:

   *  node-schedule

   *  interface-schedule

   *  attribute-schedule

   An example TVR scenario is provided below, where a a wireless link is
   shut down for 12 hours, from 19:00 to 7am the next day.  The schedule
   is identified using a schedule-id, and the recurring schedule can be
   applied for multiple days using Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

      module: ietf-tvr-node
        +--rw node-schedule
           +--rw node-id? "192.168.1.101"
           ...
           +--rw interface-schedule
              +--rw interfaces*
                 +--rw name "Wlan0"
                 ...
                 +--rw attribute-schedule
                    +--rw schedules*
                       +--rw schedule-id "0123456789"
                       +--rw (schedule-type)?
                          +--:(period)
                            ...
                             +--rw period-start "2024-10-19T19:00:00"
                             +--rw time-zone-identifier? "Europe/Paris"
                             +--rw (period-type)?
                                ...
                                +--:(duration)
                                   +--rw duration? "43200"
                                        ...
                                        +--rw attr-value
                             +--rw available? "false"

   The methods for disseminating and propagating the generated schedule
   are discussed in the following subsections.

4.5.  Management Protocols for TVR

   The TVR data model is designed to be accessed via YANG-based
   management protocols such as NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF
   [RFC8040].  This section discusses the applicability of these
   protocols for configuring time-variant network resources using the
   TVR YANG data models.

   NETCONF provides a robust mechanism for managing complex network
   configurations, particularly when transactional integrity and
   operational consistency are required.  Its ability to execute atomic
   transactions ensures that schedules involving multiple resources are
   applied in full, preventing partial updates that could lead to
   configuration inconsistencies.  This feature is important for time-
   sensitive scheduling in TVR environments.  Additionally, NETCONF
   supports validation of configurations prior to commitment, allowing
   operators to verify the correctness of schedules before they are
   applied.  It also includes rollback capabilities, enabling the
   restoration of a previous configuration in the event of scheduling
   errors.

   In contrast, RESTCONF offers a simpler, stateless method for
   interacting with network devices, making it suitable for use cases
   requiring lightweight, rapid configuration.  RESTCONF utilizes a
   RESTful interface over HTTP, providing a streamlined approach to
   network configuration and management.  Therefore, RESTCONF may be
   advantageous in scenarios where quick adjustments to schedules are
   needed or where integration with web-based or cloud-native systems is
   a priority.

   Depending on the type of node in the TVR network, NETCONF would be
   the preferred protocol for large-scale, critical scheduling
   operations requiring validation and rollback mechanisms.  For
   smaller-scale or isolated scheduling tasks, RESTCONF provides an
   efficient and straightforward option without the need for the
   transactional features offered by NETCONF.  The choice of protocol to
   use with the TVR YANG model should be driven by the specific
   requirements of the network environment and the complexity of the
   scheduling tasks involved.

   The security aspects of both NETCONF and RESTCONF including the
   strengths and weaknesses, are discussed further in Section 8
   Section 8 of this document.

5.  Time Synchronization

   According to Section 3.1.3 of [I-D.ietf-tvr-requirements], no matter
   whether the schedules are executed in a centralized or distributed
   mode, a mechanism is required to keep the time synchronization
   between different devices.

   Different time-variant scenarios may require different granularities
   of time synchronization.  For example, the period of traffic and
   topology changes in tidal networks is usually day or week.
   Therefore, a second-level time synchronization is enough.

   Existing clock synchronization protocols can be classified into
   hardware-based protocols and software-based protocols.  Hardware-
   based protocols often rely on dedicated hardware to ensure clock
   synchronization, such as Global Positioning System (GPS) and
   Precision Time Protocol (PTP).  Software-based protocols, on the
   other hand, synchronize clocks through software packages running on
   systems, such as Network Time Protocol (NTP) [RFC5905] and Simple
   Network Time Protocol (SNTP) [RFC4330].

   Hardware-based protocols typically have higher precision and
   stability, but also have higher cost due to the dedicated hardware.
   Software-based protocols are simple and applicable to common hardware
   devices, but have lower precision (For example, the NTP can realize
   the synchronization at tens of milliseconds level).  Considering the
   tidal network time synchronize requirements, the software-based
   protocols is enough.

5.1.  NTP

   NTP uses a hierarchical structure of time sources.  Each level of
   this hierarchy is termed a stratum.  Generally, an NTP server
   synchronized to an authoritative clock runs at stratum 1.  Such NTP
   server functions as the primary time server to provide clock
   synchronization for other devices on the network.  Stratum 2 servers
   obtain time from stratum 1 servers, stratum 3 servers obtain time
   from stratum 2 servers, and so on.

   In a tidal network, the managing device functions as a level-1 NTP
   server and synchronized to an authoritative clock source.  The
   network controller and network devices behave as clients to obtain
   accurate time from the managing device.  Figure 3 shows an NTP
   deployment scenario for obtaining clock from a GPS clock source.

                              +--------------------+
                              |  GPS Clock Source  |
                              +--------------------+
                                        |
                  +--------------------\|/------------------+
   Stratum 1      |             Managing Device             |

                        |                             |

                        |                             |
             +---------\|/----------+       +--------\|/--------+
   Stratum 2 |  Network Controller  |       |  Network Devices  |
             +----------------------+       +-------------------+

             Figure 3: Deployment Case of NTP in Tidal Networks

5.2.  SNTP

   SNTP is a subset of the NTP used to synchronize computer clocks in
   the Internet.  It simplifies the complex NTP synchronization function
   and is suitable for networks with limited resources and loose
   precision requirements.  Compared with NTP, SNTP has lower clock
   precision, but the synchronization precision still can be guarded
   under seconds.  Therefore, SNTP also meets the time synchronization
   requirements of tidal networks and can be used as an alternative
   clock synchronization protocol.

6.  Schedule Database

   The schedule database is used to store and maintain schedules, the
   database may be deployed on a managing device and managed devices
   based on requirements.

   The schedule source of the schedule database may be diversified, for
   example, configuration from an administrator or YANG model from the
   management interface.  The schedule entries of different databases
   may be different, but the content of the same schedule entry in the
   schedule databases of different devices in the same domain must be
   consistent.  There are at least two ways to make the content of the
   same schedule entry in different schedule databases consistent:

   *  All the schedule entries are generated at a specific device;

   *  Schedule entries are generated at different devices, but there is
      a synchronization mechanism to synchronize the schedule databases
      among devices.

   Option 1 is simplest and easy to implement.  In a time-variant
   domain, the managing device may receive scheduling requests and
   generate all schedule entries.  Then the schedule entries are
   delivered to the necessary network devices in the domain through the
   TVR YANG model.

   Option 2 relies on advertisement mechanisms (such as routing
   techniques) to advertise the scheduling data generated by itself to
   other devices.  This could be achieved using extensions to existing
   routing schemes and techniques.

6.1.  Data Structure

   [I-D.ietf-tvr-schedule-yang] defines a TVR Node and TVR Topology YANG
   modules.  The Node YANG module includes node power schedule and
   interface schedule.  The Topology YANG module includes nodes schedule
   and links schedule.

   Based on the preceding four schedule types, the schedule database
   should contain four types of schedule entries in different formats:
   Node power schedule entry, Interface schedule entry, nodes schedule
   entry, and links schedule entry.  The detailed format and fields of
   different types of schedule entries could reference to the
   definitions of corresponding YANG modules.

6.2.  Operations

   Schedule database should support the add, update, and delete
   operations.

   When adding or updating a schedule entry, the execution node needs to
   check whether resource conflicts exist between the current schedule
   and existing schedules.  If a conflict exists, the operation is
   failed.

   Schedules are updated and deleted based on schedule IDs.  Therefore,
   schedule IDs must be unique in a time-variant domain.  This can be
   handled, e.g., by a dedicated allocation agent within the time-
   variant domain.

7.  Operational Considerations

7.1.  Schedule Execution Consideration

   Schedules execution means that a component (e.g., device) undertakes
   an action (e.g., allocates and deallocates resources) at specified
   time points.  In a tidal network, the schedule execution indicates to
   power on/off specific network components (such as interfaces or
   entire network devices) directly or by commands.

   The schedule executor should understand the consequences of the
   schedule execution.  The power on/off of network components usually
   affects the network topology, the addition and deletion of the
   topology need to be considered separately.

   A link coming up or a node joining a topology should not have any
   functional change until the change is proven to be fully operational.
   The routing paths may be pre-computed but should not be installed
   before all of the topology changes are confired to be operational.
   The benefits of this pre-computation appear to be very small.  The
   network may choose to not do any pre-installation or pre-computation
   in reaction to topological additions, at a small cost of some
   operational efficiency.

   Topological deletions are an entirely different matter.  If a link or
   node is to be removed from the topology, then the network should act
   before the anticipated change to route traffic around the expected
   topological change.  Specifically, at some point before the planned
   topology change, the routing paths should be pre-computated and
   installed before the topology change takes place.  The required time
   to perform such planned action will vary depending on the exact
   network and configuration.  When using an IGP or other distributed
   routing protocols, the affected links may be set to a high metric to
   direct traffic to alternate paths.  This type of change does require
   some time to propagate through the network, so the metric change
   should be initiated far enough in advance that the network converges
   before the actual topological change.

8.  Security Considerations

   The integration of time-variant mechanisms in network operations
   presents distinct security challenges that require thorough analysis
   to safeguard the network’s integrity, availability, and
   confidentiality.  Networks that rely on time-sensitive data for
   routing and forwarding decisions are particularly susceptible to
   attacks that exploit timing dependencies.

   The "Security Considerations" section of [I-D.ietf-tvr-requirements]
   outlines various threat vectors and categories specific to time-
   variant environments.  In this document, a tidal demand use case has
   been presented, highlighting the need for robust security measures in
   the processes of generating, disseminating, and applying schedules to
   control tidal interfaces.  It is essential to assess security risks
   and implement mitigation strategies to ensure the security of both
   the network and individual nodes throughout the scheduling process.

   Future iterations of this document will provide detailed security
   techniques and best practices to address these challenges.
