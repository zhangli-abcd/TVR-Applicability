3.  Overview of Tidal Network Use Case

   Tidal network is a typical scenario of Energy Efficient case
   (Section 3 of [I-D.ietf-tvr-use-cases]).  The tidal network means
   that the volume of traffic in the network changes periodically like
   the ocean tide.  These changes are mainly affected by human
   activities.  Therefore, this tidal effect is obvious in human-
   populated areas, such as campuses and airports.

   In the context of a tidal network, if the network maintains all the
   devices up to guarantee a maximum throughput all the time, a lot of
   power will be wasted.  The energy-saving methods may include the
   deactivation of some or all components of network nodes.  These
   activities have the potential to alter network topology and impact
   data routing/forwarding in a variety of ways.  Interfaces on network
   nodes can be selectively disabled or enabled based on traffic
   patterns, thereby reducing the energy consumption of nodes during
   periods of low network traffic.  The following clauses will describe
   how to use TVR YANG model[I-D.ietf-tvr-schedule-yang] in Tidal
   Network.

4.  Applicability of TVR Yang Model in Tidal Network

4.1.  Network Model

   According to the description of Section 3.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-tvr-requirements], the scheduling generation locality and
   execution locality may be centralized or distributed.

   When the schedule is generated and executed in a centralized manner,
   the changes are sent to routing applications in wall-clock time via a
   management interface, which does not need to be delivered by YANG
   model.  This can be implemented by the existing management plane
   technology.  Therefore, this scenario is outside of the scope of this
   document.

   When the schedule is generated and executed in a distributed manner,
   there is also no need for delivering the schedule by YANG model.
   Therefore, this scenario is also outside of the scope of this
   document.

   When a schedule is generated in a centralized manner and executed in
   a distributed manner, the YANG module needs to be used to deliver the
   schedule to the managed device.  Depending on the location of the
   routing application, the network model can be devided into two types:
   distributed and centralized.

4.1.1.  Centralized Model

   In the centralized model, the network managing device generates and
   maintains schedules, the routing application is deployed in the
   network controller, and the network devices execute the schedules and
   routing results.  The following figure shows the components of
   centralized model.

    |  Network Controller  |---Routing Results-->|  Network Devices  |
    +----------------------+                     +-------------------+

4.1.2.  Distributed Model

   In the distributed model, the managing device generates and maintains
   schedules, the routing application is deployed in the network devices
   who also executes schedules and route calculation.

    |                  Managing Device                |

    |         Managed Device (Network Devices)        |
    +-------------------------------------------------+

4.2.  Interaction Between Devices

4.2.1.  Centralized Model

   Centralized model involves the interaction between the managing
   device and network controller, the managing device and network
   devices, and the controller and network devices.

   The managing device needs to deliver node-specific schedules to
   network devices by TVR Schedule Node YANG module Section 5.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-tvr-schedule-yang], and the network devices need to report
   their own status data to the management device.

   The managing device needs to deliver schedules of the network
   topology to the network controller by the TVR Network Topology YANG
   moduleSection 5.3 of [I-D.ietf-tvr-schedule-yang], so that the
   routing application in the controller can consider the impact of
   topology changes on routes when calculating routes.

   The network controller needs to delivers the route calculation result
   to the network devices(The format of the routing results depending on
   the protocols deployed).  The routing result for a period of time in
   the future could be sent to the network devices in wall-clock time or
   be packed and send at some special points.

4.2.2.  Distributed Model

   The distributed model only involves the interaction between managing
   device and network devices.

   The managing device needs to deliver node-specific schedules to
   network devices by TVR Schedule Node YANG Module, and deliver network
   topology schedules to the all the network devices by TVR Network
   Topology Yang module for route calculation.  The network devices need
   to report their own status data to the managing device.
